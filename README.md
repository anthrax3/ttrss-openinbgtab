OpenInBgTab
===========
This [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/) plugin will register a new action that opens links in a background tab by using a JS "hack", simulating a Ctrl-click on a fictive link element. This currently works in Chrome and Opera, does not work in Firefox and is not tested in anything else.

Since this is the first plugin that uses the `HOOK_HOTKEY_INFO` hook, I've commented everything rigorously in case anyone wants a sample implementation of this functionality.

Requirements
------------
TT-RSS â‰¥1.7.6.

Upstream
